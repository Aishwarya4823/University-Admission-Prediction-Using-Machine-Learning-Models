# University Admission Prediction Using Machine Learning Models

In this repository, I have implemented various machine learning models that predict whether the probability of a student getting accepted into a University offering a Masters degree.

# Data

The dataset contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs.
The parameters included are :<br>

1) GRE Scores ( out of 340 )<br>
2) TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 )<br>
3) University Rating ( out of 5 )<br>
4) Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 )<br>
5) Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 )<br>
6) Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 )<br>
7) Chance of Admit ( ranging from 0 to 1 )<br>
